Include things like:

Your preferred working style ("break into small modules, 3-file approach")
Decisions we've made ("using localStorage, no backend yet")
Feature roadmap ("next: calendar integration, document upload")
Code patterns you like

2. Start new conversations with context
Something like:

"I'm working on Casa Care (home maintenance app). We've split it into 3 files (index.html, styles.css, app.js). Working style: modular approach, prefer small incremental changes. Ready to add calendar integration to the dashboard."

3. Reference specific conversations
You can copy/paste key decisions or code snippets from our previous chats when starting new ones.

Calendar Integration ideas:

Export tasks to .ics format (works with Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar)
Show tasks in a calendar view within the app
Sync with external calendars (requires more complexity)

Document Upload ideas:

Store insurance policies, warranties, receipts per task
Photo attachments for completed tasks
Maintenance history with photos
